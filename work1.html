	  	CSS was first intended in 1994 by Håkon Wium Lie while working at CERN with a computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee.
	  	The motivation for making CSS was to provide a system to style the information which is being presented (At that time, this was solely lacking), and to isolate the process of styling from that of content creation.
		Dissimilar to the CSS2 which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 is seperated up into many individual modules which is improving both the functionality and the ease of working.
		CSS3 has managed to set a new touchstone in the development speed. Now many parts of its functionality are included what used to require a combo of CSS and Javascript. So, time is saved in the course of production, loading and lastly towards the end product.
